        Lo, in good time, crowning thy gracious word,
        ’Tis told me by these youths, Creon draws near.
    </p>

    <p><b>OED.</b></p>
    <p>
       Apollo! may his coming be as blest
       With saving fortune, as his looks are bright.
    </p>

    <p><b>PR.</b></p>
    <p>
        Sure he brings joyful news; else had he ne’er
        Worn that full wreath of thickly-berried bay.
    </p>

    <p><b>OED.</b></p> 
    <p>
        We have not long to doubt. He can hear now.
    </p>

    <p style="color: red;">[Enter CREON.]</p>

    <p>
        Son of Menoeceus, brother of my queen,
        What answer from Apollo dost thou bring?
    </p>
    <p><b>CREON.</b></p>
    <p>
        Good; for my message is that even our woes,
        When brought to their right issue, shall be well.
    </p>
    <p><b>OED.</b></p>
    <p>
        What saith the oracle? Thy words so far
        Neither embolden nor dishearten me.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>CR.</b></p> 
    <p>
        Say, must I tell it with these standing by,
        Or go within? I am ready either way.
